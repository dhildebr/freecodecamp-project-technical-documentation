          The <code>sapphire</code> is best known for its use in enchantments empowering or utilizing the element of water, or in certain restorative magics. Particularly when paired with silver, it is also boon in all efforts magical.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The traditional blue sapphire is most suited to enchantments of water and magic. Most purveyors of occult paraphernalia and mystical tchotchkes will stock a simple talisman of warding &ndash; generally modelled after Wizard Eloforn's designs &ndash; which is invariably inset with a small sapphire.</li>
          <li>On the other hand, the yellow sapphire empowers enchantments which enhance the body's natural healing ability. This is not to be confused with the similar affinity of diamond; whereas diamond is used in the immediate remedy of wounds and ills, the yellow sapphire is best when a spell only encourages natural healing. This less dramatic, but also more efficient, and is recommended for most non-emergency use cases.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Strictly speaking, a <code>ruby</code> is fundamentally the same stone as a sapphire: corundum, or aluminum oxide. Nonetheless, it is distinct both to jewelers and enchanters. Not dissimilar from a sapphire's affinity for water, a ruby is most potent in enchantments related to blood. This lends it a certain reputation as the tool of vampires and reckless hedge mages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Less sinister, ruby talismans are also helpful in bolstering a warrior's strength, and hold a minor power over fire. It also shares the yellow sapphire's affinity for restorative magics.
        </p>

        <header>Amethyst</header>
        <p>
          An <code>amethyst</code> lends itself to the powers of the wind. Staves enchanted to aid in such magics take advantage of this affinity. Aville Thondall's famous Ring of Flight Unmoored leverages the power of an amethyst to allow its wearer free flight without the use of gliders or mechanical wings.
        </p>
        <p>
          This stone also helps in flight of a different sort, that of arrows. As well as aiding in enchantments that improve one's marksmanship, the amethyst is also useful simply in enhancing the user's speed.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <code>emerald</code> is most attuned to the earth, and is a source of defensive power when enchanting.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The classic deep green emerald is best for enchantments empowering geomancy. Though the deep folk don't have much of a reuputation as mages, these are often used in ensorcelled dwarvish mining tools.</li>
          <li>Golden beryl in turn is best for defensive enchentments, particularly those conferring resistance to physical harm.</li>
          <li>An aquamarine, on the other hand, holds an affinity for the deep seas. This is more specialized than a sapphire's affinity for all manner of aqueous enchanting, and barring very specific cases is mostly to confer magical waterbreathing ability.</li>
        </ul>
        
      </section>
      
      <section class="main-section" id="Topaz">
        
        <header>Topaz</header>
        <p>
          <code>Topaz</code> is the sun's stone, brutally scorching and gently warming. This gem holds power over both fire and light, as well as sway over other "masculine" magics with direct and overt effect.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The traditional golden topaz confers the greatest power over light, and is favored by paladins and other holy warriors who wield these powers.</li>
          <li>The more uncommon red topaz in turn is aligned with fire, being more attuned to this than the ruby. The famed magical inventor Eralyn's "horseless flame-throwing arbalest," marketed as a grisly tool for mercenaries and a curiosity for the rich, takes full advantage of this alignment.</li>
        </ul>
